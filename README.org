** About

Nain is a *free & open-source*, *lightweight* and *modern* programming language
for *systems programming* and *embedded systems*.

It is designed to be *fast*, *efficient* and *easy to use*.

** Features

- *⚡ Blazingly Fast*: Nain is extremely efficient and fast, which allows you to
write high-performance applications.
- *🛠️ Low-Level Control*: Nain gives you low-level control over memory.
- *🧩 Extensible*: Nain is /very/ extensible and can be easily extended with
- *🔒 Safe*: Nain is /really/ secure. It has a strong type system and garbage

** Quick Start

*** Installation

**** Building from Source

***** Dependencies

- =rust= (>=1.7.0)

***** Installing

Run these commands to build Nain from source:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nain-lang/nain.git && cd nain
$ cargo build --release
$ nain -v # test the installation
#+END_SRC

**** Installing from Binaries

Go to [[https://get.nainlang.xyz/][the releases page]] and download the latest release for your
OS

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Note:* We provide binaries for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, macOS (OS X) and Windows.
#+END_QUOTE

Put the executable in yor PATH. On Windows this is usually =C:\Windows\System32=. On Linux
and most \*nix systems this is usually =/usr/local/bin=. On macOS this is usually =Applications=.

**** Installing from Cargo

If you have =cargo= installed, just run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cargo install nain
$ nain -v # test the installation
#+END_SRC

*** Hello World

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Note:* Nain is *not meant for begginers*!
If you have a bit of experience with other system programming languages, you
should be able to learn Nain in a few hours, or even minutes.
#+END_QUOTE

To print something to the screen, use the =printf()= function (/similar to C's printf/).

We also need to wrap this on the =main()= function, which is the entry point of
the program.

We also need to import the =studio= module, which is a collection of the most
used standard library functions. In Nain, you import modules using the
=import= keyword.

#+BEGIN_SRC nain
// This is a commend
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */

import studio

// Use func to declare a function
func main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n") // Note that in Nain the semicolon is optional
}
#+END_SRC

Now, to compile the program, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ nain comp hello.na # nain files end in .na
$ ./hello # run the program
Hello, World!
#+END_SRC

There is a /little trick/ you can use to compile run and delete the program in one command.
This is useful for testing and debugging:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ nain run hello.na # will compile, run and delete the program after running
Hello, World!
#+END_SRC

** Documentation

There are tons of hand-crafted tutorials on the [[https://docs.nainlang.xyz/][website].

The documentation is really comprehensive and non-technical (except for the
[[https://wiki.nainlang.xyz/][wiki]]).
